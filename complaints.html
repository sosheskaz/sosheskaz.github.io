As this is a website where I write purely for my own enjoyment and satisfaction, I am very concerned with any and all
complaints. Thus, I created the sosheskaz.github.io complaints department, powered by the ultra-fast and
ultra-lightweight database platform known as /dev/null.

<br>

Enter your complaint below:

<br>

<form id="complaintform">
    <textarea form="complaintform" class="form-control" style="height: 200px;"></textarea>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" class="btn-primary col-md-2 col-md-offset-5" value="Save to /dev/null!">
</form>
