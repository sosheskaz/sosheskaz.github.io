    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/01/27/Apple-Watch-Review.html">Apple Watch Review</a></h1>
    <div>
        <p>So, I’ve recently come into posession of an Apple Watch. 
I like to wait before making value judgements on things, so here I am
writing a review a month later. For the record, this is a 42mm Series
2 model.</p>

<h1 id="overall">Overall</h1>
<p>In the time I’ve had it, I’ve gained a very favorable opinion of the
Apple Watch. Its user experience is definitely one of the best I’ve
experienced, and it feels very polished. Notably, integrating it 
into my daily life felt like second-nature, and I’ve even found 
myself using the features that I initially saw very little appeal 
in – in large part due to the incredible user experience that the
designers have achieved.</p>

<h1 id="cool-things-it-does">Cool Things it Does</h1>
<p>I’m going to start out by listing a lot of the really cool and
useful features of the watch that make an impact in my daily life.</p>

<h2 id="1-activity-tracking--health">1. Activity Tracking &amp; Health</h2>
<p>Let me just start out by saying that if you’re a hardcore runner or
athlete, this watch will not replace your Garmin. It’s a consumer
product, not a professional one.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
<img src="files/images/posts/2017-01-27-Activity.jpg" class="col-md-3" />

<p>
This is a feature I was very skeptical about; I occasionally go to
the gym or do a small workout, but for the most part my main
exercise is my habit of pacing around. However, the health features
of the watch are so easy to use, and so good, that I found myself
using them regardless, and feel much better for it.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: You have 3 circles: red, green, and blue. The
red circle tracks the calories you've burned over the course of the
day. The green tracks how many minutes you've moved/exercised for. The blue
tracks how many hours in the day in which you've stood up and moved
around *at least once*. There are goals set for each circle - the 
calorie goal is set to 500 by default (but is variable), while the exercise and stand
goals are set for 30 and 12, respectively. If you haven't stood up
in the last hour, at the 50 minute mark, it'll give you a little 
tap on your wrist and remind you to stand up and move around a little.
It sounds kind of silly, but it's a really effective psychological
reward mechanism.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there's a program called "Breathe". This is a really
simple little app that guides you through a deep breathing exercise.
It uses the sensor to figure out when you're a little stressed (or
in my case, drinking coffee) and offers to guide you through a deep
breathing exercise to cool down. I was skeptical of this too, but
I've found I feel a lot better when I do this – even for just a 
minute – once a day.

</p>
</div>

<h2 id="2-notifications--and-the-sweet-sound-of-silence">2. Notifications – And the Sweet Sound of Silence</h2>
<p>Next up: the notifications on the watch. Personally, I’ve permanently
switched my phone to silent mode, because the tap on the wrist that
the Apple Watch gives you when you receive notifications is both
more noticeable and less disruptive than traditional phone notification
noises. Further, it lets you more efficiently ignore the unimportant
notifications you receive – newsletters, facebook comments, unimportant
texts – which is ultimately really nice. Of course, since the time
is also on the watch (duh), I’ve ultimately wound up looking at my
phone much less. For the little things you look at your phone for –
the time, the weather, music skipping/volume, notifications, timers – 
the Apple watch steps up and fills the role more conveniently and with
more subtlety.</p>

<h2 id="3-ping-or-mute-your-phone">3. Ping or Mute your Phone</h2>
<p>How often do you misplace your phone right next to you, but aren’t
sure where it is? Or go somewhere where you probably should turn on
Do Not Disturb mode, but meh it’s on vibrate and it’ll probably be fine.
The watch has quick buttons to do both of these things for you. You
can instantly turn Do Not Disturb on or off, and instantly make your
iPhone make a noise (or if you hold it down, flash the LED too) to
help you find it. Honestly, this is one of the smartest things they did.</p>

<h2 id="ending-the-rule-of-three">Ending the Rule of Three</h2>
<p>Of course there are lots of other cool things to do, including: auto-unlocking
your mac, being a stopwatch/nightstand-alarm-clock/timer, showing your
daily calendar, being a remote for your camera, and more – but this post
is already pretty long and I don’t want to bore you too much.</p>

<h1 id="complaints-and-grievances">Complaints and Grievances</h1>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a fair review if I didn’t list some negatives.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-screen-is-small">1. The Screen is Small</h2>
<p>I knew this going in, but ultimately, there are simply limits on
what you can do with an interface on a 1.6” (or 1.5”) screen. While I think
Apple and third party vendors have, for the most part, created 
good interfaces given the screen size, it ultimately always falls
a little short. Force touch, the first time I used it, was a 
disappointment. For those not in the loop, force touch is a feature
in Apple’s touch screen products where applying more pressure when
selecting an item (i.e. pressing harder) performs a contextual action,
usually a menu related to the item you pressed. The second-gen Apple
Watches have this feature, but it doesn’t activate based on the item
you pressed, it activates based on the app or screen that is open.
This essentially makes force touch a “third button” rather than
adding a third dimension to the touch screen and, while it makes
sense for a screen this small, is disappointing.</p>

<h2 id="2-no-third-party-watch-faces">2. No Third-Party Watch Faces</h2>
<div class="col-md-12">
<img src="files/images/posts/2017-01-27-Face.jpg" class="col-md-3" />

<p>
One of the nice things, and something Apple put a good deal of 
effort into, was the watch faces. This is what you look at when 
you open your watch. Don't get me wrong, the customization is not
disappointing and the offerings are fairly good, but I believe
that third-party faces could add a lot of utility to the product.
Attached is the main face I use; it has buttons – called "complications" – 
to display extra information besides the time. The complications
come in multiple sizes, and third-party apps can be allowed to use them.
However, the watch faces are all created and controlled by Apple,
which throttles this customizability.
</p>
</div>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="3-the-app-screen">3. The App Screen</h2>
<div class="col-md-12">
<img src="files/images/posts/2017-01-27-AppScreen.jpg" class="col-md-3" />

<p>
The app screen is arranged hexagonally. The rationale behind this
is understandable; it makes more sense when looking at this kind
of screen than the traditional rectangular grid. That said, working
with this screen is awful. I personally set up my watch faces such
that I can avoid this screen as much as possible. It's harder to
navigate, remember where apps are, and see apps. If I'm looking
for a specific app, I'll often miss it once or twice while looking
for it. Further, it's terrible to organize; unlike when moving 
apps on an iPhone, the direction that apps are displaced when one
moves them is unpredictable. This makes organizing the app screen
a pain, which of course makes it even harder to use.
</p>
</div>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>Overall, the Apple Watch is very thoughtfully designed, offers a
lovely user experience, and integrates easily into one’s daily
routine. Being able to swap out watch bands is easy and cheap, so
it can be dressed for any occasion.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-buy-it">Should I buy it?</h2>
<p>…Probably not. While it’s certainly very cool (and useful), the starting 
price of $269 is, in my opinion, a bit steep. Despite this, if you
have money to burn and want a cool, handy gadget this may be for
you. It also makes an excellent and thoughtful gift.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Apple offers discounts through its refurbished store,
where prices start at $229. In my experience (this was typed on a
refurbished Apple computer), their refurbishing program is just as
good as brand new.</p>
