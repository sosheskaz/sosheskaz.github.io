As a developer, I'm always on the lookout for good software libraries to make my life easier. Here are 
some I like.

# C# #
* [NDesk.Options](http://www.ndesk.org/Options) - Quick and easy command line options parser.
* [Command Line Parser](https://commandline.codeplex.com/) - More sophisticated and powerful, but somewhat
harder to use, command line options parser.
* [JSON.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) - All things JSON.

# Python
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - Python library for very powerful mathematical and scientific analysis.
If you're doing statistical analysis, look no further.
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) - Make command-line status bars easily from Python or from
the command line.

# Ruby
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - Secure ruby web authentication.
* [iMessage-ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/imessage) - Send iMessage messages from a ruby script or
from the command line.

# Swift
* [AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - Easy, elegant networking.
* [SwiftyBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver) - Thorough, easy-to-use Swift logging 
framework.
