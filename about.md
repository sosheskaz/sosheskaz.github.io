I'm a Software Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I also mentor fabrication/machining at a local
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 1675. Occasionally, I'll write things about the technology industry, technology politics,
or really anything I feel interested in writing about. Those things will be put here as I write them.

I like webcomics. Here are my favorites:
* [Paranatural](http://www.paranatural.net)
* [Questionable Content](https://questionablecontent.net)
* [Sam and Fuzzy](http://www.samandfuzzy.com)
* [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal (SMBC)](http://www.smbc-comics.com)
* [Scandinavia and the World (SATW)](http://satwcomic.com)
* [Surviving the World](http://survivingtheworld.net)
* [Three Panel Soul](http://threepanelsoul.com)
* [Whomp!](http://www.whompcomic.com)
* [XKCD](https://xkcd.com)
