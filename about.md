I'm a Software Engineer working at a company called Cleo. Occasionally, I'll write things 
about the [technology industry]({{site.categories['Technology'][0].url}}),
technology politics, my [attempts]({{site.tags['humor'][0].url}}) at 
[humor]({{site.tags['humor'][1].url}}), [tutorials]({{site.categories['Tutorial'][0].url}}), or really anything I feel interested in writing about. 
Those things will be put here as I write them.

Because I tend to follow Apple (BSD with slightly less hassle), many of my posts are centered around
the [Apple environment]({{site.tags['swift'][0].url}}) (MacOS, iOS, etc.) as well as analysis of Apple's activities, products, and philosophies.

Of course, I have other interests too, and since the purpose of this website is for me to flex and develop 
my writing skills, there will be a lot of content about other things as well.
