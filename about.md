<h1 class="post-title"><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h1>

I'm a Software
Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I also mentor fabrication/machining at a local FIRST
Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 1675. Occasionally, I'll write things about the technology industry,
technology politics, my attempts at humor, or really anything I feel interested in writing about. Those
things will be put here as I write them.

Because I am in the Apple Developer Program, as well as an Apple fan/enthusiast, many of my posts are centered around
the Apple environment (MacOS, iOS, etc.) as well as analysis of Apple's activities, products, and philosophies.

Of course, I have other interests too, and since the purpose of this website is for me to flex my writing skills,
there will be a lot of content about other things as well.
