I'm a Software 
Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I also mentor fabrication/machining at a local FIRST 
Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 1675. Occasionally, I'll write things about the technology industry, 
technology politics, my attempts at humor, or really anything I feel interested in writing about. Those 
things will be put here as I write them.

You may be wondering why Spotify iOS Documentation is linked here. The reason is simply that I want a
controlled hosted location for them, as I'm currently working on a project that depends on the iOS Spotify
SDK. They are purely here for my convenience and benefit.
