<h1 class="post-title"><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h1>

I'm a Software 
Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I also mentor fabrication/machining at a local FIRST 
Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 1675. Occasionally, I'll write things about the technology industry, 
technology politics, or really anything I feel interested in writing about. Those things will be put here as I write
them.
