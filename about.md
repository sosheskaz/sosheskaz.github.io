I'm a Software
Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I also mentor fabrication/machining at a local FIRST
Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 1675. Occasionally, I'll write things about the technology industry,
technology politics, my attempts at humor, or really anything I feel interested in writing about. Those
things will be put here as I write them.

Because I am in the Apple Developer Program, as well as an Apple fan/enthusiast, many of my posts are centered around
the Apple environment (MacOS, iOS, etc.) as well as analysis of Apple's activities, products, and philosophies.

I'm also interested in electronic security, in particular security as it applies to consumers. This means
I may often write about how security works & how it applies to consumers, or guides on how a consumer can
easily utilize good security practices.

Of course, I have other interests too, and since the purpose of this website is for me to flex and develop 
my writing skills, there will be a lot of content about other things as well.
