I'm a Software
Engineering student at [Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)](https://msoe.edu). I also mentor fabrication/machining 
at a local FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team, [Team 1675](http://www.team1675.net/). Occasionally, I'll write things 
about the [technology industry]({{site.categories['Technology'][0].url}}),
technology politics, my [attempts]({{site.tags['humor'][0].url}}) at 
[humor]({{site.tags['humor'][1].url}}), [tutorials]({{site.categories['Tutorial'][0].url}}), or really anything I feel interested in writing about. 
Those things will be put here as I write them.

Because I am in the Apple Developer Program, as well as an Apple fan/enthusiast, many of my posts are centered around
the [Apple environment]({{site.tags['swift'][0].url}}) (MacOS, iOS, etc.) as well as analysis of Apple's activities, products, and philosophies.

I'm also interested in electronic security, in particular security as it applies to consumers. This means
I may often write about how security works & how it applies to consumers, or guides on how [a consumer can
easily utilize good security practices](/security/2017/01/17/How-To-Secure-Your-Online-Life.html).

Of course, I have other interests too, and since the purpose of this website is for me to flex and develop 
my writing skills, there will be a lot of content about other things as well.
