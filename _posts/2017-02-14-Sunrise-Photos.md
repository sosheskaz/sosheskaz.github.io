A few nights ago, I was up all night working. Around 6:30 AM I got done, and my watch told me it was less
than half an hour until sunrise (which was at 6:52). On a whim, I decided to go to the top of the hill by my house and
try to take some pictures. It turned out to be a really nice view, where even though it was obfuscated by
the lake, I could just barely see the horizon over the lake. I also like urban photography, so the early
morning street was another nice aspect in my opinion. The sun came out right in the corner of where the 
lake met some towers, which was less than ideal for me, but I still feel they came out well.

The photos were also taken with the iPhone's "Live Photos" function, where 1.5 seconds before and after
the photo are captured as low-framerate (albeit good enough to look decent) video. The photos here don't
reflect this, but the movement of the cars add a nice dimension to the early-morning city.
