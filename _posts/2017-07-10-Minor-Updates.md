# Some Minor Updates

No full-size post today, I just figured I'd post a bit about what I'm doing and
what I'm working on.

I'm in Rockford, working as a software engineer for Cleo, in particular working
on cloud infrastructure.

As far as side projects, I've got a few irons in the fire.

* Booze - In Progress - A utility for mac homebrew users, especially those working
with some of the more bleeding-edge libraries and such, as well as system
administrator types. V1 is currently out, and it just sets up twice-daily
auto-updates of software. You can get it
[here](https://github.com/sosheskaz/booze-homebrew-updater). V2 will have a lot
more functionality, like auditing logs, machine migration utilities, and a
"blame" feature, that helps track down which update broke something so you can
track it down and fix it.
* DnDMap - In Progress - A helpful thing for DnD players. It's basically just a *free* way to
share dungeon maps, live, over the internet. This will help groups that are not
located together, or that have issues with traditional maps, to play more
seamlessly.
* Website - Not Started - I want to move my website over to a more
fully-featured and customizable content management system. This will be a pain
though, and take a while, so I'm putting it off.

I just adopted two little kittens, Sam (gray) and Fuzzy (white). They're very
docile, gentle, and well-behaved. Fuzzy's still pretty scared of my apartment,
but Sam has been bravely exploring and has been quite social.
