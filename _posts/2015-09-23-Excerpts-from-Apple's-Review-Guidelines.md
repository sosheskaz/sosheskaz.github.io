From this document: [https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)

- "â€¦if your app is plain creepy, it may not be accepted"
- "We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour."
- "We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it"."
- "If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps."
