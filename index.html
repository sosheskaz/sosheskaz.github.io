        <p>
            I am a Software Engineering student at MSOE University. I especially like databases and data analytics/visualization.
            I also volunteer for a <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> team,
            Team 1675, nicknamed the Ultimate Protection Squad.

        <h1>Computer Science</h1>
        <p>
            I've been learning computer science since my junior year of high school, in 2011.
            I've worked in a variety of languages, including C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.
            I like making cool web apps and scripts, especially when it involves working with databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I'm often playing with new operating systems and a personal server. Currently, I'm running FreeBSD
            on my server, and am quite liking it. The ports system is nice, and the whole operating system is very tightly controlled.
        </p>
        <h1>Coffee</h1>
        <p>
            I like coffee, and in particular, I like working in coffeehouses. They're great for socializing, working, and enjoying delicious coffee.
            My favorite is <a href="https://anodynecoffee.com">Anodyne</a>.
